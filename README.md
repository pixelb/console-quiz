These are 40 questions and answers I gave to a coder dojo group,
with supporting utilties to display questions and answers at the console.

  `show-questions` is a python program than shows all questions

  `show-answers` is a shell program that diffs questions.txt and questions-answers.txt
  for a particular round, starting at 1

questions-answers.txt is created first, with a blank line separating questions.
When finised, just delete the answers in a copy called questions.txt

The 40 example questions here took about 90 minutes to go through.
The teams were given standard blank table quiz sheets to fill out their answers.
